ResearchEng Portfolio is a portfolio template designed to be fast and easy to maintain. It includes a section for research, which is often not included in standard developer portfolio templates.

The site is designed to be served directly from object storage such as Amazon S3 but can also be deployed using Apache, Nginx, or other web server. Example instructions for serving a website from Amazon S3 can be found [here](https://medium.com/@kyle.galbraith/how-to-host-a-website-on-s3-without-getting-lost-in-the-sea-e2b82aa6cd38).
