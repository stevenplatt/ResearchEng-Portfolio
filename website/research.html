    <h4>"Working from Home and Employee Performance during the COVID-19 Pandemic in the UK"</h4>
        <p><i>S Deole, Y Huang, M Deter. Labour Economics, 2022.</i></p>
        <p>In 2020, many governments responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by encouraging employees to work from home (WFH). Analyzing representative data from the UK, we find that the pandemic-led increases in WFH frequency are associated with a higher self-perceived hourly productivity among employed respondents. Interestingly, changes in WFH frequency are unrelated to the respondents' weekly working hours and weekly wages during the same period. While the WFH-productivity association is more substantial in non-lockdown months, it is inexistent during the months with strict lockdowns, indicating that lockdown measures inhibited the baseline association. The WFH-productivity association is weaker among parents with increased homeschooling needs due to school closures implemented during lockdowns. In addition, the effect heterogeneity analysis identifies the role of crucial job-related characteristics in the baseline association. Finally, looking at the future of WFH, we show that employees' recent WFH experiences and subsequent changes in hourly productivity are intimately associated with their desires to WFH in the future.</p>

    <h4>"Do negative emotions cause immigration concerns?"</h4>
        <p><i>S Deole, Y Huang. GLO DP Series 644. R&R (3rd) at the Journal of Population Economics, 2022.</i></p>
        <p>This paper examines the role of individuals' emotions in determining their concerns about international migration. For the empirical analysis, we construct an index of negative emotions (<em>NE index</em>) from previously less explored information on individuals' self-reported frequency of experiencing anger, fear, and sadness in the German Socio-Economic Panel data. The results indicate that a higher NE index is positively associated with increased immigration concerns. To infer causality, we exploit the exogenous variation in NE index induced by the individual's parent's death and apply fixed effects regressions with instrumental variables. The analysis finds evidence of a positive causal impact of negative emotions for females, but effects are found among males. The baseline effects for females vary across their social characteristics and personality traits. Finally, we also find that negative emotions determine females' support for far-right political parties but do not affect their left-wing support, implying real-life consequences.</p>

    <h4>"Immigrant-native gap in risk and time preferences in Germany"</h4>
        <p><i>S Deole, M O Rieger. Journal of Population Economics, 2022.</i></p>
        <p>We present new descriptive evidence on the immigrant-native gap in risk and time preferences in Germany, one of immigrants’ most preferred destination countries. Using the recent waves of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) dataset, we find that the immigrant-native gap in risk preferences has widened for recent immigration cohorts, especially around the time of the 2015 European Refugee Crisis. We attribute the recent widening to decreased assimilation rates of new immigrants caused by reduced integration due to sudden increases in immigrants flows from culturally diverse parts of the world, particularly around the year 2015. We also find that the immigrant-native gap varies across different migrant groups: “Opportunity seekers,” which we define as economic immigrants who intend to stay in Germany only temporarily, are very similar in their risk preferences to natives. Other immigrants, however, are substantially more risk averse than natives. A smaller gap in risk preferences is also found among migrants who are female, highly educated, proficient in the host language, self-employed, and working in predominantly high-skilled jobs. Concerning time preferences, a noticeably large immigrant-native gap is evident, but the gap does not vary across most individual-level socio-economic variables.</p>

    <h4>"Justice delayed is assimilation denied: Right-wing terror and immigrants' assimilation in Germany"</h4>
        <p><i>S Deole. Labour Economics 59: 69-78, 2019.</i></p>
        <p>In 2011 a German right-wing extremist group was exposed in the media as having killed individuals of Turkish ethnicity in the early 2000. The press coverage highlighted the inability of authorities to name perpetrators sooner. Authorities were criticized for (alleged) institutional racism. In this paper, we show that this episode reinforced significantly a feeling of estrangement among Turkish immigrants, who become less likely to self-identify as Germans. This episode was also followed by a substantial decrease in their health satisfaction and subjective wellbeing.</p>

    <h4>"Refining the Salience Hypothesis"</h4>
        <p><i>S Deole, L Davis. International migration 59(1): 21-37, 2021.</i></p>
        <p>Applied to immigration, Blalock's (Toward a Theory of Minority-Group Relations. A Capricorn Giant, 1967) salience hypothesis predicts that contact with immigrants will tend to highlight the role of nationality in the identities of natives and thereby increase opposition to immigration. Drawing on group threat and cultural perspectives hypotheses, we consider the roles of macroeconomic conditions and national culture in salience effects. Our results indicate that economic concerns over immigration are more sensitive to the immigrant population share during difficult economic times and in countries with less religious diversity and more collectivist cultures. In contrast, cultural concerns over immigration are not sensitive to the macroeconomic and cultural variables we examine. Thus, the attitudinal response to immigration differs significantly across countries, a finding that is relevant to attempts to manage the social and political consequences of large immigration inflows.</p>

    <h4>"Human Capital Consequences of Violence in Schools: Estimating the Impact of Violence in Schools on Education Outcomes in Brazil"</h4>
        <p><i>S Deole. Review of Development Economics 22(1): 287-310, 2018.</i></p>
        <p>Implementation of policies to reduce the incidence of violence in schools needs a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and its consequences for the victims, perpetrators, and witnesses alike. However, much of the existing literature either focuses on the impact of violence on victim students or studies the specific cases of violent conflicts. Using Brazilian education data, this paper examines the impact of violence in schools on educational outcomes of the schooling system and emphasizes the human capital consequences of recorded violent incidents in schools. First, the paper establishes the psychological stress-threat mechanism by which violent incidents in schools directly impact students' mathematics test scores as well as school level average of these test scores. Thereafter, the paper demonstrates the reduced learning mechanism by which violence further detriments the quality of education, albeit indirectly, by disengaging the teachers and students from their professional responsibilities. The main results are tested for robustness and policy implications are discussed.</p>
